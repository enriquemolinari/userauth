# User Auth

This is an Authentication and Authorization back-end service to demonstrate how it works with SPA applications as part of my book [Understanding React](https://leanpub.com/understandingreact). This book is completely free for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).

# Install and Start

- Install maven on your computer
- git clone https://github.com/enriquemolinari/userauth.git userauth
- mvn install
- mvn exec:java. This will start Javalin/Jetty with the services running on Port: 1234.
