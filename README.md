# User Auth

This is an Authentication and Authorization back-end service to demonstrate how it works with SPA applications as part of my book [Understanding React](https://leanpub.com/understandingreact).

# Install and Start

- Install maven
- git https://github.com/enriquemolinari/userauth.git userauth
- then run: mvn exec:java. This will start Javalin/Jetty with the services running on Port: 1234.
